        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>H5 Game Park was founded by a group of gaming enthusiasts who grew tired of websites cluttered with intrusive ads and poorly made games. We wanted to create a place where we ourselves would love to play—a trusted park for online games. This project is a labor of love, and we are constantly working to improve the site and add new, exciting titles to our library.</p>
        
        <p>Thank you for visiting. We hope you have a fantastic time playing!</p>
